## ‚úÖ Projects

### 1. **Dog Breed Classification** üê∂  
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to classify dog breeds from images.  
- **Technique:** CNN  
- **Dataset:** [Dog Breeds Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedchahed/dog-breeds)  
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix  

---

### 2. **Facial Emotion Recognition** üòäüò¢üò†  
A model that detects human facial expressions and classifies them into emotional states.  
- **Emotions:** Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, etc.  
- **Dataset:** [AffectNET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mstjebashazida/affectnet)  

---

### 3. **Gender Classification from Names** üßîüë©  
Predicts a person's gender from their name.  
- **Task:** Binary Gender Classification (0 = Male, 1 = Female)  
- **Dataset:** [Gender Names Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gracehephzibahm/gender-by-name)  

---

### 4. **Gender Classification from Images** üì∑üßîüë©  
A CNN-based model to classify gender from facial images.  (0 => Females, 1 => Males)
- **Technique:** CNN for image-based classification  
- **Dataset:** [UTKFace Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new)

---

### 5. **Dogs vs Cats Classification** üê∂üê±  
A binary image classification project using **VGG16** pretrained model with fine-tuning to distinguish between dog and cat images.  
- **Technique:** Transfer Learning with VGG16  
- **Dataset:** [Dog and Cat Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/dog-and-cat-classification-dataset)

### 6. **Stock Price Prediction (Apple Inc.)** üìàüçè  
A regression-based machine learning model to predict the stock **closing price** of Apple (AAPL) using historical data from **Yahoo Finance (2015‚Äì2024)**.

---

## üìö Libraries Used
- **pandas**
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**
- **scikit-learn**
- **yfinance**

---

- **Task:** Time Series Regression  
- **Target:** `Close` price  
- **Features Used:** `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Volume`, `Date`  
- **Dataset Source:** [Yahoo Finance ‚Äì AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL)  

- **ML Algorithms:**  
  - `LinearRegression`  

- **Preprocessing Steps:**  
  - Datetime parsing and sorting  
  - Feature selection  
  - Train/Test split using `train_test_split`  
  - Optional feature scaling (e.g., MinMaxScaler)

- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - **R¬≤ Score** ‚Äì Measures how well the model explains variance in the target  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** ‚Äì Average of squared prediction errors  
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** ‚Äì Average of absolute prediction errors  

> üìå **Note:**  
> R¬≤ Score is not the same as classification accuracy.  
> - R¬≤ ranges from ‚àí‚àû to 1, with **1 meaning perfect prediction**  
> - Accuracy applies to classification, not regression tasks

- **Output:**  
  - Predictive model for Apple closing prices  
  - Visualization of Actual vs Predicted prices  
  - Average daily prediction error (e.g., $0.02 USD)
